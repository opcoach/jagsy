# jagsy  a new editor for JAGS
 

Jagsy aims to provide a simple editor for writing clean JAGS code. Jagsy speeds up the development of JAGS code by providing auto-formatting, syntax checking and auto-completion.

Jagsy is based on the eclipse framework module and as such can be incorporated to Eclipse RCP applications. Jagsy comes with a stand-alone application that can be straightforwardly used on the three main operating systems, i.e., linux/mac/windows

This project  is a collaboration between [OPCoach (France)](http://www.opcoach.com/en)  and Arxios (Belgium - @bhlbarxios).
